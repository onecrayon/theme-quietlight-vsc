# Quiet Light for VSC

Quiet Light for VSC is a light, peaceful theme, ported to Visual Studio Code by me, the designer of the original Quiet Light theme for MacRabbit's Espresso text editor on macOS.

When I launched Visual Studio Code for the first time I was surprised and delighted to find that my Quiet Light theme was included by default. However, it was a little rough around the edges (I didn't have anything to do with the Textmate port of the theme), and thus Quiet Light for VSC was born.

I hope you enjoy working by Quiet Light! Please [let me know](http://onecrayon.com/about/contact/) if you run across any problems or have any suggestions to make it better (or alternately [submit a pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/onecrayon/theme-quietlight-vsc)).
